1) Making armrespawn & correspawn buildable [on land].

2) Assigning appropriate build icon for resource generators (and preferably name as well)

3) Making more neval units available would be excellent (converters, nanos, plasma deflectors, [cor] fusion).

4) Making a geo or two buildable anywhere (with lower energy output than on geospot)

5) Renaming lootboxnanos.

6) Renaming of Core Radars to include vision/cameras.

7) Enabling shields on some select units (Some energy production and Bastion (at present))
