VERY EARLY stages of development as of early Jan 2024.

Implimenting a significant reconfiguration and rebalancing of Base building, eco and defencive units to better suit the desires and demands of Raptor play.
Due to the use of Scav and Naval units for the player(s) to use on land, this is not suitable for games against Scav AI or on map where players will build in the water.

Additional Technology Tiers are introduced to enable the players to evolve the layout and configuaration of their eco and defences throughout games, rather than simply building more and more of the same things.
In order to avoid CPU melting server configurations with thsouands of raptors, increasing tech level focuses weapon power from lots of low power pew pew to more focused very high power zap.  Therefore increased raptors health, rather than raptor count is advised.
