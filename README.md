As the Raptor influence swept across the universe, the eternally waring machine factions were forcing to evolve, unite and fight for their continued existance.  
They have all but purged locomotion from their design to enhance their defensive capabilities, requiring less land to fuel their assorted weaponry, incorporating the bio-weaponry of their Raptor foe.

Implimenting a significant reconfiguration and rebalancing of Base building, eco and defensive units to better suited to the desires and demands of Raptor play.
Due to the use of Scav and Naval units for the player(s) to use on land, this is not suitable for games against Scav AI or on map where players will build in the water.

Additional Technology Tiers are introduced to enable the players to evolve the layout and configuaration of their eco and defences throughout games, rather than simply building more and more of the same things.
In order to avoid CPU melting server configurations with thsouands of raptors, increasing tech level focuses weapon power from lots of low power pew pew to more focused very high power zap.  Therefore increased raptors health, rather than raptor count is advised.

Buildtime on Eco structures in particularly will be reduced to improve reclaim speed, reducing the need for base-spread.

T1 (Bronze), T2 (Silver) T3 (Gold), T4 (Platinum) Tiers use Eco and Defence builder turrets.

Eco turrets are the Upgrade path, Defence can only build their own level.
Eco turrents can build -1, = & +1 tech level builders along with their own Metal converters, and fragile nanos upto and including their own level along with  Primary, alternative and optional Energy production, Utility and shield structures.
Defnse turrets can build their own level builders and strong nanos upto and including their tech level, along with guns, support and shield of their level.

Weapons typically have ranges that fall into bands of "short", "medium" and "long range" with atloeast one option of those three ranges in each tier, thought the size and style of the weapons will vary, providing multiple defense style to be adopted, with valid options in all tiers.


Better utilization of weapon toggles for defense structures are intended to be implimented, increasing the skill ceiling for maximum efficacy.
An Overcharged option is hoped to be incorporated to nano turrets for lower efficiency but greater build power (perhaps will damage taken over time, which could distract nanos).

Currently only 2 tiers of nanos are available, T1 and T3.  If floating models become available, this will be expanded to all four tiers.


Some select T2, T3, T4, T5 units will be able available, from labs and nanobuilders (units too large for the labs).
